## **Overview**

**Pong** is one of the earliest arcade video games, and this implementation captures the essence of the original game. Players control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth, with the goal of scoring points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

### **Features:**
- Single or local multiplayer mode
- Realistic paddle and ball physics
- Sound effects for bouncing and game over
- Score tracking and display

## **Requirements**

To run the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- `winsound` for sound effects (Windows only)

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamadabcn/pong.git
   cd pong

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## **Usage**

3. **Run the Pong game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Gameplay
**Controls**:

Player X (Left Paddle):
